# CaseStudy_LinearRegression

## Summary
This project involves 3 Case Studies where linear Regression is used for analysis.

## 1) Case Study - Ground Cricket Chirps

In The Song of Insects (1948) by George W. Pierce, Pierce mechanically measured the frequency (the number of wing vibrations per second) of chirps (or pulses of sound) made by a striped ground cricket, at various ground temperatures. Since crickets are ectotherms (cold-blooded), the rate of their physiological processes and their overall metabolism are influenced by temperature. Consequently, there is reason to believe that temperature would have a profound effect on aspects of their behavior, such as chirp frequency.

In general, it was found that crickets did not sing at temperatures colder than 60ยบ F. or warmer than 100ยบ F.

## 2) Case Study - Brain vs Body Weight

In the file brain_body.txt, the average brain and body weight for a number of mammal species are recorded. Load this data into a Pandas data frame.

## 3) Case Study - Salary Discrimination

The file salary.txt contains data for 52 tenure-track professors at a small Midwestern college. This data was used in legal proceedings in the 1980s about discrimination against women in salary.

The data in the file, by column:

Sex. 1 for female, 0 for male.

Rank. 1 for assistant professor, 2 for associate professor, 3 for full professor.

Year. Number of years in current rank.

Degree. Highest degree. 1 for doctorate, 0 for master's.

YSdeg. Years since highest degree was earned.

Salary. Salary/year in dollars.
